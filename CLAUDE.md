# Claude Code Instructions

This project uses shared AI assistant instructions. Read and follow the guidelines in:

**[.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)**

That file contains all project-specific conventions, testing requirements, build processes, and coding standards that apply to both GitHub Copilot and Claude Code.
