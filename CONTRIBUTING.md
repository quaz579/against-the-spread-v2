# Contributing to Against The Spread

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project uses AI-assisted development with human code review.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project is designed to be implemented primarily by AI agents with human oversight. Before contributing, please:

1. **Read [`.agents.md`](.agents.md)** - Complete guide for AI agents
2. **Review [`implementation-plan.md`](implementation-plan.md)** - Detailed implementation steps
3. **Follow the testing strategy** - Tests must be written first (TDD)
4. **Check frequently** - Compile and test after each change

## 📋 Development Workflow

### For AI Agents

1. **Review Context**
   - Read `.agents.md` for project structure and guidelines
   - Review relevant sections of `implementation-plan.md`
   - Understand the current phase of development

2. **Implement Feature**
   - Write failing tests first (TDD)
   - Implement minimum code to pass tests
   - Refactor and optimize
   - Update documentation

3. **Validate Changes**
   - Run `dotnet build` - ensure compilation succeeds
   - Run `dotnet test` - ensure all unit tests pass (156+ tests)
   - Run E2E tests - `./start-e2e.sh && cd tests && npm test` (2+ tests)
   - Test locally with Azurite and browsers
   - Verify changes against acceptance criteria
   - **A task is NOT complete until ALL tests pass**

4. **Commit Changes**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - Reference issue numbers where applicable

### For Human Reviewers

1. **Review Phase**
   - Check that tests were written first
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Review code quality and adherence to patterns
   - Test locally if needed
   - Provide feedback or approve

2. **Approval Criteria**
   - All tests passing
   - Code follows established patterns
   - Documentation updated
   - No security issues
   - Performance acceptable

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

All contributions MUST include tests:

**CRITICAL: All tests must pass before any PR is merged:**
- Unit tests: `dotnet test` (156+ tests)
- E2E tests: `cd tests && npm test` (2+ tests, requires `./start-e2e.sh`)

### Unit Tests
- Test all business logic
- Mock external dependencies
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Clear test names describing scenario

Example:
```csharp
[Fact]
public void ParseLinesFromExcel_WithValidFile_ReturnsWeeklyLines()
{
    // Arrange
    var service = new ExcelService();
    var stream = GetTestFileStream();
    
    // Act
    var result = service.ParseLinesFromExcel(stream);
    
    // Assert
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
    result.Week.Should().Be(1);
}
```

### Integration Tests
- Test with Azurite (local Azure Storage)
- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Validate file operations

### Component Tests (Blazor)
- Use bUnit for component testing
- Test user interactions
- Verify rendered output

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- Validate complete user flows
- Test admin authentication and uploads
- Verify Excel download format
- See `tests/README.md` for complete guide
- Add new tests for significant UI/API changes
