### API Testing

#### Test GET /api/weeks

```bash
# Replace with your Function App URL
FUNC_URL="https://your-function-app.azurewebsites.net"

# Get available weeks for 2025
curl "$FUNC_URL/api/weeks?year=2025"

# Expected response:
# {
#   "year": 2025,
#   "weeks": [1, 2, 3]
# }
```

#### Test GET /api/lines/{week}

```bash
# Get lines for Week 1
curl "$FUNC_URL/api/lines/1?year=2025"

# Expected response: WeeklyLines JSON with games array
# {
#   "week": 1,
#   "year": 2025,
#   "games": [
#     {
#       "favorite": "Alabama",
#       "line": -9.5,
#       "vsAt": "vs",
#       "underdog": "Florida State",
#       ...
#     },
#     ...
#   ]
# }
```

#### Test POST /api/picks

```bash
# Submit picks and download Excel
curl -X POST "$FUNC_URL/api/picks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "week": 1,
    "year": 2025,
    "picks": ["Alabama", "Ohio State", "Michigan", "Georgia", "Texas", "Clemson"]
  }' \
  --output picks.xlsx

# Verify file downloaded
file picks.xlsx
# Should show: Microsoft Excel 2007+

# Open and verify format
```

### Mobile Testing

Test on actual mobile devices or Chrome DevTools device mode:

#### iPhone (Safari)
- [ ] Test in portrait mode
- [ ] Test in landscape mode
- [ ] Verify buttons are easily tappable
- [ ] Verify download works on iOS

#### Android (Chrome)
- [ ] Test in portrait mode
- [ ] Test in landscape mode
- [ ] Verify buttons are easily tappable
- [ ] Verify download works on Android

### Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

## Excel Format Validation

Critical: Output Excel must EXACTLY match "Weekly Picks Example.csv" format.

### Validation Script

```bash
# Compare generated Excel with reference format
python3 << 'EOF'
import openpyxl

# Open generated file
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('picks.xlsx')
ws = wb.active

# Validate structure
assert ws['A1'].value == '', "Row 1 should be empty"
assert ws['A2'].value == '', "Row 2 should be empty"
assert ws['A3'].value == "Name", "A3 should be 'Name'"
assert ws['B3'].value == "Pick 1", "B3 should be 'Pick 1'"
assert ws['G3'].value == "Pick 6", "G3 should be 'Pick 6'"

# Validate data row
assert ws['A4'].value is not None, "Row 4 should have name"
assert ws['B4'].value is not None, "Row 4 should have Pick 1"
assert ws['G4'].value is not None, "Row 4 should have Pick 6"

print("✅ Excel format validation passed!")
EOF
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing (Optional)

Use Apache Bench or Artillery to test API performance:

```bash
# Install Apache Bench
brew install apache-bench  # macOS

# Test GET /api/weeks
ab -n 1000 -c 10 "$FUNC_URL/api/weeks?year=2025"

# Test GET /api/lines/1
ab -n 1000 -c 10 "$FUNC_URL/api/lines/1?year=2025"
```

Expected results on Consumption plan:
- Average response time: < 500ms
- 95th percentile: < 1000ms
- No failures

## Security Testing

### API Security Checklist

- [ ] Anonymous access works for all endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured to allow web app origin
- [ ] Storage blobs are private (not publicly accessible)
- [ ] No sensitive data in API responses
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors (not using SQL)
- [ ] Proper error handling (no stack traces to user)

### Test CORS

```bash
# From browser console on web app
fetch('$FUNC_URL/api/weeks?year=2025')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)

# Should succeed without CORS error
```

### Test Storage Security

```bash
# Try to access blob directly (should fail)
curl "https://your-storage.blob.core.windows.net/gamefiles/lines/week-1-2025.xlsx"
# Expected: 404 or 403 (blob is private)
```

## Automated Integration Tests (Future Enhancement)

For Phase 8+, consider adding:

### Azurite Tests for Storage Service

```csharp
// Example using Azurite
[Fact]
public async Task StorageService_WithAzurite_UploadsAndRetrievesLines()
{
    // Start Azurite in Docker
    // Test actual blob operations
    // Verify JSON parsing
}
```

### HTTP Integration Tests for Functions

```csharp
// Example using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing
[Fact]
public async Task GetWeeks_ReturnsValidResponse()
{
    var client = _factory.CreateClient();
    var response = await client.GetAsync("/api/weeks?year=2025");
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
}
```

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **JSON Parsing in Upload Script**
   - Script creates placeholder JSON
   - Actual parsing happens on-demand by API
   - Future: Add .NET CLI tool to parse during upload

2. **No User Authentication**
   - MVP has no login/auth
   - Anyone can make picks
   - Future: Add Azure AD B2C or similar

3. **No Pick History**
   - Picks are downloaded, not stored
   - No way to retrieve past picks
   - Future: Store picks in Cosmos DB or Table Storage

4. **Limited Error Handling**
   - Basic error messages
   - Future: Better UX for network errors

### Testing Gaps

1. Integration tests with real Azure services (Azurite setup needed)
2. E2E tests with Playwright or Selenium
3. Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
4. Internationalization testing

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

- **Code Changes**: Update tests before merging PR
- **New Features**: Add tests as part of feature implementation
- **Bug Fixes**: Add regression test before fixing bug
- **API Changes**: Update contract tests immediately

### Test Review Checklist

Before merging:
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] CI passes on GitHub Actions
- [ ] Code coverage hasn't decreased
- [ ] New features have tests
- [ ] Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- [ ] Tests are isolated (no shared state)
- [ ] Tests have descriptive names

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics to Track

1. Test count trend
2. Code coverage percentage
3. Test execution time
4. Flaky test count (should be 0)
5. Bug escape rate (bugs found in prod vs tests)

### Goals

- Maintain 80%+ code coverage
- Keep test suite under 5 minutes
- Zero flaky tests
- Add integration tests in next iteration
